# Steam Tag Snagger
> A Python script and/or .exe to easily pull game information from Steam (Tags, Name, Devs/Pubs)
This script and/or executable runs in terminal due to the simplicity of the project. It by default repeats the request for user input until the user closes the program. Can be modified to write to a .txt file or to remove the default repetition. 

## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è
* Python - Single python file with simple logic using the requests library, and bs4 from BeautifulSoup.
* Steam Store Page - A user will be presumably supplying a game's Steam store page to the program, which will scrape/parse the page for required information.

## NOTES:
- Include image "guide" in this README file
- Convert to standard HTML parser?
